It’s beautiful to me because my children grew up here, I grew up here, visited my mum here, and I got married from here—all just precious memories I will hold very, very dear, always",

Here, one look, and you can see the children playing—sometimes it really feels just like our hometown in India, and I’m really going to miss that.",

    text: "Tanglin Halt, to me, was always a very important point when I travelled by train. It was very picturesque, because back in the day there were the small squatter huts lining the side of rail corridor. It wasn’t a crime back then to squat, and I would always visualise people throwing out their illegal items from the windows of the train before reaching the checkpoint at Tanjung Bakar! So now, when I walk the rail corridor with my daughters, I always relive that moment, imagining someone hiding in the bush and waiting to scurry out and collect the prized contraband.",

Tanglin Halt is a very unique, singular place, one that you can’t find anywhere else. There’s a great mix of history and the present here, with beautiful stories and experiences in between.",

Next time if my grandchildren ask me about Tanglin Halt, I will say it’s the only place with 3 hawker centres together. It’s very special, I think nowhere else has this. But I’m not sad that it’s going to be demolished, I’m really looking forward to the new place—sure very nice, very clean!",

There are so many people who make it what it is to me like Dr. Goh, our trusted family doctor, or the durian store owner who always says hi to me, and the shop owner of the Cai and Cai shop. Who can forget Amin, the most epic and probably best shoe cobbler in all of Singapore, and even the auntie who would always push her beloved dog around in a pram like a baby and feed him milo! There are just so many things I will miss about the place and I am very saddened to see it go.",

I brought up my children here, and my grandchildren too—they would play along the corridors and would say hello to our neighbours, running in and running out of houses. Nowadays, the neighbours aren’t the same. Doors are closed, and people are different. That’s what makes me sad.",

    text: "The redevelopment really affects a lot. Some of the residents have been staying here for over 50 years, and the thing is, when we move over, people won’t be able to adjust to it. Because we won’t have a market and hawker like this! A lot of them are senior citizens, their kids have grown up, so they need a place to come together—to do what they’re used to. To me, it’s just too different from Tanglin Halt.",
